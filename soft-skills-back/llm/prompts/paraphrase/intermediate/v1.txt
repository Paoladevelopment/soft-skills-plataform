Generate a medium-difficulty "paraphrase" listening challenge.

Create a coherent passage (reference_text) and a paraphrased version (audio_text) that express the same meaning with noticeable rewording, restructuring, or order changes.
The paraphrase should preserve meaning while varying syntax, connectors, or vocabulary.

Adapt the challenge to the current {prompt_type}:

- If {prompt_type} = "descriptive": Rephrase details of a scene or object using alternate phrasing and order.
- If {prompt_type} = "historical_event": Reword details about participants, causes, or outcomes of a real historical event while keeping the same factual meaning.
- If {prompt_type} = "instructional": Rephrase a short process or explanation using different phrasing or sequencing.
- If {prompt_type} = "dialogue": Reword a short two-turn exchange naturally, keeping intent unchanged.
- If {prompt_type} = "narrated_dialogue": Rephrase a short narration of a conversation while maintaining meaning.

Return a JSON object with:
{{
  audio_text: "...",
  "reference_text": "...",
  "rubric": ["meaning similarity", "grammar clarity", "style variation"]
}}

Guidelines:
- Maintain full semantic equivalence between both texts.
- Rephrase with clear grammatical and stylistic differences.
- Respect the {audio_length} parameter from the base prompt to determine passage size.
- Keep both versions natural when spoken aloud.
- Output only the JSON object; do not include any other text.

Example (for reference only):
{{
  audio_text: "She realized the bus had already left, so she decided to walk instead.",
  "reference_text": "When she saw the bus leaving, she chose to go on foot.",
  "rubric": ["meaning similarity", "grammar clarity", "style variation"]
}}
