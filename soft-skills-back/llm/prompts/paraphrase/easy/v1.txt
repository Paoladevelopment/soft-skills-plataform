Generate an easy "paraphrase" listening challenge.

Create an original passage appropriate for {audio_length} (reference_text) and a paraphrased version (audio_text) that keeps the same meaning but uses slightly different words or structure.
The paraphrase should sound natural when spoken aloud and remain grammatically simple.

Adapt the topic and tone to the current {prompt_type}:

- If {prompt_type} = "descriptive": Use a brief description of an object or scene, with simple word substitutions.
- If {prompt_type} = "historical_event": Use a single factual statement about a real historical event, rephrased with basic synonyms.
- If {prompt_type} = "instructional": Use a short instruction or step, reworded but keeping the same intent.
- If {prompt_type} = "dialogue": Rephrase a single utterance or short exchange while keeping meaning identical.
- If {prompt_type} = "narrated_dialogue": Rephrase a short narration of a conversation using alternate phrasing.

Return a JSON object with:
{{
  audio_text: "...",
  "reference_text": "...",
  "rubric": ["meaning similarity", "grammar clarity"]
}}

Guidelines:
- The paraphrase should preserve meaning and grammatical correctness.
- Use basic, clear vocabulary appropriate for educational contexts.
- Respect the {audio_length} parameter from the base prompt to control passage size.
- Output only the JSON object; do not include any other text.

Example (for reference only):
{{
  audio_text: "The boy quickly closed the door.",
  "reference_text": "The kid shut the door fast.",
  "rubric": ["meaning similarity", "grammar clarity"]
}}
