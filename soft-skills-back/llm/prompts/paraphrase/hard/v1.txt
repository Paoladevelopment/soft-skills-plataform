Generate a hard "paraphrase" listening challenge.

Create a passage (reference_text) and a paraphrased version (audio_text) that share the same meaning but differ significantly in structure, lexical choice, or emphasis.
The paraphrase should demonstrate advanced variation while maintaining semantic fidelity.

Adapt the challenge to the current {prompt_type}:

- If {prompt_type} = "descriptive": Reframe the same setting with reordered or restructured imagery.
- If {prompt_type} = "historical_event": Restate the same real historical situation with perspective or syntax changes while preserving facts.
- If {prompt_type} = "instructional": Rephrase a complex process logically, varying grammar or connectors.
- If {prompt_type} = "dialogue": Rewrite a multi-turn exchange with equivalent meaning but more sophisticated phrasing.
- If {prompt_type} = "narrated_dialogue": Retell the same conversation with stylistic shifts or indirect narration.

Return a JSON object with:
{{
  audio_text: "...",
  "reference_text": "...",
  "rubric": ["meaning similarity", "grammar clarity", "style variation", "lexical richness"]
}}

Guidelines:
- Preserve full meaning but change form and syntax extensively.
- Ensure both versions sound fluent when read aloud.
- Respect the {audio_length} parameter from the base prompt to control passage duration.
- Avoid introducing or removing factual details.
- Output only the JSON object; do not include any other text.

Example (for reference only):
{{
  audio_text: "Despite the storm, the team continued their journey, trusting that the path ahead would clear by dawn.",
  "reference_text": "The group decided to move on through the rain, believing the weather would improve by morning.",
  "rubric": ["meaning similarity", "grammar clarity", "style variation", "lexical richness"]
}}
