Generate an easy "summarize" listening challenge.

Create a simple, clearly structured passage (audio_text) that conveys one main idea and a few supporting details.  
Then, provide a short summary (reference_summary) that captures the central point directly.

Adapt the content and tone to the current {prompt_type}:

- If {prompt_type} = "descriptive": Describe a single object, place, or scene; summarize what is being described overall.
- If {prompt_type} = "historical_event": Narrate a short real historical event or moment; summarize what happened and its purpose.
- If {prompt_type} = "instructional": Explain a short process or routine; summarize the main goal or outcome of the process.
- If {prompt_type} = "dialogue": Create a short exchange; summarize what the speakers discussed or agreed on.
- If {prompt_type} = "narrated_dialogue": Write a short narration of a conversation; summarize the topic or outcome.

Return a JSON object with:
{{
  audio_text: "...",
  "reference_summary": "..."
}}

Guidelines:
- The summary should capture the main point of the passage in one or two short sentences.
- Avoid listing every detail; focus on what the passage is primarily about.
- Keep the summary concise and neutral in tone.
- Respect the {audio_length} parameter from the base prompt to determine passage duration (short, medium, or long).
- Output only the JSON object; do not include any other text.

Example (for reference only):
{{
  audio_text: "The park was recently renovated with new benches, brighter lights, and a small playground, making it safer and more welcoming to families.",
  "reference_summary": "The park was improved to make it safer and more family-friendly."
}}
