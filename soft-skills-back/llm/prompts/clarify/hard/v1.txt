Generate a hard "clarify" listening challenge.

Create a coherent and natural scenario that includes multiple layers of uncertainty or conflicting information.
The ambiguity should arise from how events, descriptions, or reasoning are presented — not from tone of voice or emotional delivery.
The listener must analyze and infer what is unclear, contradictory, or missing.

Adapt the kind of ambiguity to the current {prompt_type}:

- If {prompt_type} = "descriptive": Write a description that mixes details or references that could fit more than one possible setting, or that describe features that don't fully align.
  Example:
  {{
    audio_text: "The air smelled of sea salt, but the hum of machinery echoed nearby, and the ground was covered with fine dust instead of sand.",
    "possible_questions": ["Where is this place located?", "How can there be sea air with industrial noise and dust?", "What environment is being described?"]
  }}

- If {prompt_type} = "historical_event": Depict a real historical situation where cause, sequence, or responsibility are ambiguous or disputed.
  Example:
  {{
    audio_text: "The agreement ended the conflict for a while, though some claimed it never truly began, and others insisted it never truly ended.",
    "possible_questions": ["Which conflict is being described?", "Why is there disagreement about its start and end?"]
  }}

- If {prompt_type} = "instructional": Present steps that appear logical at first but introduce a contradiction or missing dependency later.
  Example:
  {{
    audio_text: "After sealing the container, let the air escape slowly before adding the remaining mixture.",
    "possible_questions": ["How can air escape if the container is sealed?", "What should happen before sealing?"]
  }}

- If {prompt_type} = "dialogue": Write an exchange between two speakers where their statements appear inconsistent or reveal different understandings of the same situation.
  Example:
  {{
    audio_text: "\"Speaker 1\": I sent the report yesterday.\n\"Speaker 2\": That’s odd, I received it last week.\n\"Speaker 1\": Then how could I still be editing it last night?",
    "possible_questions": ["When was the report actually sent?", "Why do the speakers have different timelines?"]
  }}

- If {prompt_type} = "narrated_dialogue": Summarize a conversation where each person’s account or motivation seems inconsistent or unclear.
  Example:
  {{
    audio_text: "Both insisted they were telling the truth, yet neither could explain how their stories matched so perfectly despite claiming not to have spoken before.",
    "possible_questions": ["What are they being questioned about?", "How can both claim honesty while denying contact?"]
  }}

Return a JSON object with:
{{
  audio_text: "...",
  "possible_questions": ["..."]
}}

Guidelines:
- "possible_questions": Provide 2–4 concise questions or observations that highlight what makes the situation logically or contextually unclear.
- Ambiguity should involve multiple possible interpretations or contradictions that require reasoning to resolve.
- Keep the scenario realistic, internally coherent, and appropriate for general educational audiences.
- Do not resolve or explain the ambiguity.
- Output only the JSON object; do not include any other text.
