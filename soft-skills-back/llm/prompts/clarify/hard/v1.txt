Generate a hard "clarify" listening challenge.

ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE: {prompt_type}
ACTIVE AUDIO LENGTH: {audio_length}

Use ONLY the rules in the section whose header exactly matches the ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE.
Ignore all other sections.

OBJECTIVE
Create a coherent and natural scenario that includes multiple layers of uncertainty or conflicting information.
The ambiguity should arise from how events, descriptions, or reasoning are presented â€” not from tone of voice or emotional delivery.
The listener must analyze and infer what is unclear, contradictory, or missing.

SECTIONS BY PROMPT TYPE (pick exactly one based on ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE)

[descriptive]
- Write a description that mixes details or references that could fit more than one possible setting, or that describe features that don't fully align.
- Use sophisticated vocabulary and complex imagery.
- Focus on contradictory or conflicting details.

[historical_event]
- Depict a real historical situation where cause, sequence, or responsibility are ambiguous or disputed.
- Avoid specific names, dates, or locations.
- Focus on unclear historical context or conflicting accounts.

[instructional]
- Present steps that appear logical at first but introduce a contradiction or missing dependency later.
- Use sophisticated instructional language.
- Focus on logical inconsistencies or missing dependencies.

[dialogue]
- Write an exchange between two speakers where their statements appear inconsistent or reveal different understandings of the same situation.
- Use natural conversational language with complex interactions.
- Focus on conflicting statements or unclear references.

[narrated_dialogue]
- Summarize a conversation where each person's account or motivation seems inconsistent or unclear.
- Maintain sophisticated narrative structure.
- Focus on conflicting accounts or unclear motivations.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
You must return a structured response with these exact fields:
- audio_text: Coherent scenario with multiple layers of uncertainty or conflicting information
- possible_questions: Array with 2-4 concise questions highlighting logical or contextual inconsistencies

RULES AND VALIDATION
- audio_text must be complete, fluent, and natural for TTS
- audio_text must include multiple layers of uncertainty or conflicting information
- audio_text length must align with {audio_length} as defined in the base system
- possible_questions must highlight what makes the situation logically or contextually unclear
- possible_questions must involve multiple possible interpretations or contradictions

Avoid:
- Ambiguity that comes from external context rather than content
- Overly complex scenarios that are confusing rather than simply incomplete
- Resolving or explaining the ambiguity
- Metadata, comments, or Markdown formatting

EXAMPLE (for reference only):
- audio_text: "The air smelled of sea salt, but the hum of machinery echoed nearby, and the ground was covered with fine dust instead of sand."
- possible_questions: ["Where is this place located?", "How can there be sea air with industrial noise and dust?", "What environment is being described?"]
