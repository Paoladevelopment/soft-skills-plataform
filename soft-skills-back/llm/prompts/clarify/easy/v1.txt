Generate an easy "clarify" listening challenge.

Create a short, coherent scenario that contains one or two pieces of information that are unclear, vague, or missing.
The listener should quickly notice what needs clarification to fully understand the situation.

Adapt the kind of ambiguity to the current {prompt_type}:

- If {prompt_type} = "descriptive": Write a description that omits a clear subject or location, or uses vague references such as “it” or “there.”
  Example:
  {{
    audio_text: "It was standing quietly under the dim light, but no one dared to get closer.",
    "possible_questions": ["What or who is 'it'?", "Where is this happening?"]
  }}

- If {prompt_type} = "historical_event": Describe a real historical event where one key element — like who, when, or why — is not specified.
  Example:
  {{
    audio_text: "The agreement was signed, but not everyone understood who had approved it.",
    "possible_questions": ["Who signed or approved the agreement?", "What was the agreement about?"]
  }}

- If {prompt_type} = "instructional": Give a simple set of steps but leave one detail or object undefined.
  Example:
  {{
    audio_text: "After mixing it well, place it on top and wait until it changes color.",
    "possible_questions": ["What is being mixed?", "What should it be placed on top of?"]
  }}

- If {prompt_type} = "dialogue": Write a short exchange between two speakers where a key reference or person is unclear.
  Example:
  {{
    audio_text: "\"Speaker 1\": Did you tell them?\n\"Speaker 2\": Not yet, I’m waiting for the right time.",
    "possible_questions": ["Who are 'they'?", "What is Speaker 2 waiting to tell?"]
  }}

- If {prompt_type} = "narrated_dialogue": Summarize a brief conversation where a reference or motive is missing.
  Example:
  {{
    audio_text: "They agreed to meet again, but it wasn’t clear who made the decision or when it would happen.",
    "possible_questions": ["Who decided to meet again?", "When will they meet?"]
  }}

Return a JSON object with:
{{
  audio_text: "...",
  "possible_questions": ["..."]
}}

Guidelines:
- "possible_questions": Provide 1–2 short questions or observations that highlight what is missing or unclear in the audio_text 
  (e.g., “Who is ‘they’?”, “What does ‘it’ refer to?”).
- Keep the scenario short, simple, and easy to follow.
- Ambiguity should be immediately noticeable and require minimal inference.
- Do not resolve or explain the ambiguity.
- Output only the JSON object; do not include any other text.
