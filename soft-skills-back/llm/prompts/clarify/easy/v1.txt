Generate an easy "clarify" listening challenge.

ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE: {prompt_type}
ACTIVE AUDIO LENGTH: {audio_length}

Use ONLY the rules in the section whose header exactly matches the ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE.
Ignore all other sections.

OBJECTIVE
Create a short, coherent scenario that contains one or two pieces of information that are unclear, vague, or missing.
The listener should quickly notice what needs clarification to fully understand the situation.

SECTIONS BY PROMPT TYPE (pick exactly one based on ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE)

[descriptive]
- Write a description that omits a clear subject or location, or uses vague references such as "it" or "there."
- Keep vocabulary simple and accessible.
- Make the ambiguity immediately noticeable.

[historical_event]
- Describe a real historical event where one key element — like who, when, or why — is not specified.
- Avoid specific names, dates, or locations.
- Focus on the missing historical context.

[instructional]
- Give a simple set of steps but leave one detail or object undefined.
- Keep instructions clear but incomplete.
- Focus on the missing procedural element.

[dialogue]
- Write a short exchange between two speakers where a key reference or person is unclear.
- Use natural conversational language.
- Focus on unclear references or missing context.

[narrated_dialogue]
- Summarize a brief conversation where a reference or motive is missing.
- Maintain clear narrative structure.
- Focus on unclear references or missing context.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
You must return a structured response with these exact fields:
- audio_text: Short scenario with one or two unclear or missing pieces of information
- possible_questions: Array with 1-2 short questions highlighting what is missing or unclear

RULES AND VALIDATION
- audio_text must be complete, fluent, and natural for TTS
- audio_text must contain one or two pieces of information that are unclear, vague, or missing
- audio_text length must align with {audio_length} as defined in the base system
- possible_questions must highlight what is missing or unclear in the audio_text
- possible_questions must be short and immediately noticeable

Avoid:
- Overly complex ambiguity that requires extensive inference
- Resolving or explaining the ambiguity
- Unclear scenarios that are confusing rather than simply incomplete
- Metadata, comments, or Markdown formatting

EXAMPLE (for reference only):
- audio_text: "It was standing quietly under the dim light, but no one dared to get closer."
- possible_questions: ["What or who is 'it'?", "Where is this happening?"]
