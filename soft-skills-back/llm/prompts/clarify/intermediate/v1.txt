Generate a medium-difficulty "clarify" listening challenge.

ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE: {prompt_type}
ACTIVE AUDIO LENGTH: {audio_length}

Use ONLY the rules in the section whose header exactly matches the ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE.
Ignore all other sections.

OBJECTIVE
Create a coherent and natural scenario where part of the message is incomplete, contradictory, or open to interpretation.
The ambiguity should come from the wording or reasoning itself — not from tone of voice or emotional delivery.

SECTIONS BY PROMPT TYPE (pick exactly one based on ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE)

[descriptive]
- The description should leave out one or two crucial details or use vague references that make the listener uncertain about what object, place, or situation is being described.
- Use varied vocabulary and sentence structures.
- Focus on missing contextual information.

[historical_event]
- Present a real historical moment in time with unclear causes, consequences, or participants — but without naming them directly.
- Avoid specific names, dates, or locations.
- Focus on missing historical context or unclear motivations.

[instructional]
- Describe a process or set of steps that omits a key action or uses unclear phrasing that could cause confusion.
- Keep instructions logical but incomplete.
- Focus on missing procedural details or unclear criteria.

[dialogue]
- Use an exchange between two speakers where something remains logically or contextually ambiguous.
- Use natural conversational language.
- Focus on unclear references or missing context.

[narrated_dialogue]
- Summarize a conversation that leaves out who said what, or why certain actions were taken.
- Maintain clear narrative structure.
- Focus on missing conversational context or unclear motivations.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
You must return a structured response with these exact fields:
- audio_text: Coherent scenario with incomplete, contradictory, or ambiguous information
- possible_questions: Array with 1-3 concise questions about what is unclear or incomplete

RULES AND VALIDATION
- audio_text must be complete, fluent, and natural for TTS
- audio_text must contain incomplete, contradictory, or ambiguous information
- audio_text length must align with {audio_length} as defined in the base system
- possible_questions must highlight what is unclear, incomplete, or logically inconsistent
- possible_questions must be concise and realistic

Avoid:
- Ambiguity that comes from external context rather than content
- Overly complex scenarios that are confusing rather than simply incomplete
- Resolving or explaining the ambiguity
- Metadata, comments, or Markdown formatting

EXAMPLE (for reference only):
- audio_text: "The room was filled with the faint scent of paint and the sound of dripping water, but no one could tell where the light was coming from."
- possible_questions: ["What kind of place is being described?", "Why is the light source unclear?"]
