Generate a medium-difficulty "cloze" listening challenge.

ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE: {prompt_type}
ACTIVE AUDIO LENGTH: {audio_length}

Use ONLY the rules in the section whose header exactly matches the ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE.
Ignore all other sections.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- You MUST return a JSON object with exactly these 3 fields: "audio_text", "text_with_blanks", "answers"
- "audio_text": Complete text WITHOUT any blanks (___). This is what will be spoken aloud.
- "text_with_blanks": Same text as audio_text but with 2–3 words replaced by "___".
- "answers": Array with the missing words in order.
- The "audio_text" MUST NEVER contain blanks, underscores, or placeholders.
- Return ONLY the JSON object — no explanations or additional text.

OBJECTIVE
Create a coherent passage appropriate for {audio_length}, where two or three meaningful words are omitted.
The blanks should require attention to meaning and context to fill correctly.
The challenge should remain accessible to general learners, encouraging contextual reasoning rather than recall of isolated words.

SECTIONS BY PROMPT TYPE (pick exactly one based on ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE)

[descriptive]
- Describe a place, object, or situation using several interconnected details.
- Remove 2–3 descriptive words (nouns, adjectives, or adverbs) that influence the listener’s understanding.
- Maintain grammatical correctness and natural rhythm even with blanks.

[historical_event]
- Describe a real historical event, omitting 2–3 key elements such as actions, time references, or participants.
- Ensure the blanks are inferable through logic and context.
- Avoid explicit names, numeric data, or trivia.

[instructional]
- Explain a process or task involving several steps or materials.
- Omit 2–3 verbs or nouns that represent essential but guessable parts of the process.
- Keep the tone conversational and flowing, without lists.

[dialogue]
- Write a natural conversation between two speakers labeled "Speaker 1" and "Speaker 2".
- Omit 2–3 context-dependent words (verbs, objects, or places) that affect meaning but can be inferred.
- Alternate turns with line breaks ("\n"); avoid narration or commentary.

[narrated_dialogue]
- Write a third-person narration summarizing a conversation between two or more people.
- Omit 2–3 references, actions, or decisions that require comprehension of context to restore.

The response must strictly follow this structure:
