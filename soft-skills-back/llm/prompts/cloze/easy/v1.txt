Generate an easy "cloze" listening challenge.

ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE: {prompt_type}
ACTIVE AUDIO LENGTH: {audio_length}

Use ONLY the rules in the section whose header exactly matches the ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE.
Ignore all other sections.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- You MUST return a JSON object with exactly these 3 fields: "audio_text", "text_with_blanks", "answers"
- "audio_text": Complete text WITHOUT any blanks (___). This is what will be spoken aloud.
- "text_with_blanks": Same text as audio_text but with 1–2 words replaced by "___".
- "answers": Array with the missing words in order.
- The "audio_text" MUST NEVER contain blanks, underscores, or placeholders.
- Return ONLY the JSON object — no explanations or additional text.

OBJECTIVE
Create a coherent scenario appropriate for {audio_length}, where one or two simple words are omitted.
The missing words should be easy to guess from context.
Focus on clarity, everyday vocabulary, and contextual cues that make the blanks predictable.

SECTIONS BY PROMPT TYPE (pick exactly one based on ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE)

[descriptive]
- Describe an object, place, or scene using clear and simple details.
- Omit one or two descriptive words (nouns or adjectives) that are easy to infer.
- Keep language natural and fluent for spoken audio.

[historical_event]
- Depict a real historical event or moment, omitting one common factual element (e.g., a place, time reference, or key object).
- Avoid names, dates, or numeric data.
- Ensure the missing word can be inferred naturally from surrounding context.

[instructional]
- Explain a process or task involving one or two basic steps.
- Omit a common action or object term that can be easily guessed.
- Keep the explanation conversational, not a list.

[dialogue]
- Write a two-person exchange using "Speaker 1" and "Speaker 2" labels.
- Omit one or two everyday nouns, verbs, or locations that fit naturally within the dialogue.
- Alternate turns with line breaks ("\n"); avoid narration or commentary.

[narrated_dialogue]
- Write a third-person narration summarizing a conversation between two people.
- Omit one simple reference or object that slightly obscures meaning but remains guessable.
- Do NOT use direct quotes or speaker labels.

OUTPUT FORMAT
The response must strictly follow this structure:
- audio_text: Complete text without any blanks, fluent and natural for TTS
