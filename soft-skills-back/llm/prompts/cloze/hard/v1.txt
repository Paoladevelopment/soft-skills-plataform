Generate a hard "cloze" listening challenge.

CRITICAL: The audio_text field must contain the COMPLETE text without any blanks (___). 
Only the text_with_blanks field should contain blanks. The audio_text is what will be spoken aloud.

Create a coherent passage appropriate for {audio_length} with multiple blanks.
The missing words or short phrases should require careful reasoning and deep context understanding to complete.

Adapt the challenge to the current {prompt_type}:

- If {prompt_type} = "descriptive": Describe a complex environment where several interrelated details (e.g., objects, actions, or conditions) are omitted.
  Example: "The sophisticated laboratory contained advanced equipment for conducting molecular research experiments."

- If {prompt_type} = "historical_event": Depict a real historical event where several key elements (dates, actions, outcomes) are blanked out, requiring historical or logical inference.
  Example: "During the Industrial Revolution, technological innovations transformed manufacturing processes and revolutionized economic systems."

- If {prompt_type} = "instructional": Give comprehensive step-by-step instructions for a complex process where multiple steps or dependencies are missing.
  Example: "To conduct a research study, formulate a hypothesis, design the methodology, collect data systematically, analyze results statistically, and draw evidence-based conclusions."

- If {prompt_type} = "dialogue": Create a multi-turn conversation where the omitted words alter the flow or understanding of what's happening. Follow the dialogue format from system.txt with "Speaker 1" and "Speaker 2".
  Example: "\"Speaker 1\": I've been working on this project for months. \"Speaker 2\": What kind of challenges have you faced?"

- If {prompt_type} = "narrated_dialogue": Write a complex narration about a conversation (single voice, no "Speaker 1/2" format).
  Example: "The CEO presented the quarterly results to the board, highlighting the challenges faced during the economic downturn."

Return a JSON object with:
{{
  audio_text: "...",
  "text_with_blanks": "...",
  "answers": ["..."]
}}

Guidelines:
- audio_text: MUST contain the COMPLETE text without any blanks (___). This is what will be spoken aloud.
- "text_with_blanks": Replace 3â€“5 meaningful words or short phrases with "___". This version has the blanks.
- "answers": List all missing words in correct order.
- Ambiguity should come from reasoning, not grammar errors.
- Ensure each blank affects comprehension and forces inference.
- Keep the text logically coherent and appropriate for educational use.
- Output only the JSON object; do not include any other text.

Example (for reference only):
{{
  audio_text: "\"Speaker 1\": I've been working on this project for months.\n\"Speaker 2\": What kind of challenges have you faced?\n\"Speaker 1\": The main issue was finding reliable suppliers who could meet our quality standards.",
  "text_with_blanks": "\"Speaker 1\": I've been working on this ___ for months.\n\"Speaker 2\": What kind of ___ have you faced?\n\"Speaker 1\": The main ___ was finding reliable suppliers who could meet our quality ___.",
  "answers": ["project", "challenges", "issue", "standards"]
}}
