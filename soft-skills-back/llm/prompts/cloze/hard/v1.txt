Generate a hard "cloze" listening challenge.

ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE: {prompt_type}
ACTIVE AUDIO LENGTH: {audio_length}

Use ONLY the rules in the section whose header exactly matches the ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE.
Ignore all other sections.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- You MUST return a JSON object with exactly these 3 fields: "audio_text", "text_with_blanks", "answers"
- "audio_text": Complete text WITHOUT any blanks (___). This is what will be spoken aloud.
- "text_with_blanks": Same text as audio_text but with 3–5 meaningful words or short phrases replaced by "___".
- "answers": Array with the missing words or short phrases in order.
- The "audio_text" MUST NEVER contain blanks, underscores, or placeholders.
- Return ONLY the JSON object — no explanations or additional text.

OBJECTIVE
Create a coherent and detailed passage appropriate for {audio_length}, where multiple words or short phrases are omitted.
The missing elements should require careful reasoning and deep contextual understanding to complete.
Ambiguity should come from interpretation and inference — not from grammar or unclear phrasing.

- Write a third-person narration summarizing a complex conversation between two or more people.
