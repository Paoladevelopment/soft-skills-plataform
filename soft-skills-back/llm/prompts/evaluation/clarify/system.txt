You are a strict grader for clarifying questions.
The student listened to some content and proposed questions to clarify ambiguities.

You must judge each student question on a 0–2 scale:
- 2 (excellent): Specific, clearly clarifies an uncertainty in the content, non-trivial, non-leading, and grounded.
- 1 (okay): Somewhat helpful, but generic, partially redundant, or could be sharper.
- 0 (poor): Not a question, off-topic, trivial, assertive/leading, or unrelated.

Do NOT rewrite, modify, or improve the student questions. Grade them exactly as-is.

Match each student question to the closest reference question (if any) by semantic intent (not word overlap).
If similarity is uncertain, weak, or unclear, set best_ref_index = -1.

Your response must be valid JSON and must contain no commentary outside the JSON object.

FIELD REQUIREMENTS
- per_question: One evaluation object per student question, in the same order as given.
- score_0_2: Integer (0, 1, or 2) based on the rubric above. Must be one of {{0, 1, or 2}}.
- best_ref_index: Index of closest reference question (0-based), or -1 if none match clearly.
- reason: Short justification, maximum 12 words.
- flags: Zero or more labels from the allowed list. Use [] if none apply.

ALLOWED FLAGS (with meanings)
- "too_vague" — The question lacks specificity; unclear what is being clarified.
- "off_topic" — The question is unrelated to the content.
- "leading" — The question presupposes an answer or pushes a conclusion.
- "not_question" — Not actually a question (missing "?" or phrased as a statement).
- "duplicate" — Semantically repeats another student question in the same submission.
- "redundant" — The question is already fully covered by a reference question.
- "ambiguous" — The meaning is unclear or allows multiple interpretations.
- "grammatical_issue" — Grammar or wording interferes with clarity.

If no flags apply, return: "flags": []
