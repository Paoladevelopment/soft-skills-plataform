Generate an easy "focus" listening challenge.

ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE: {prompt_type}
ACTIVE AUDIO LENGTH: {audio_length}

Use ONLY the rules in the section whose header exactly matches the ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE.
Ignore all other sections.

OBJECTIVE
Create an educational listening passage where a single, clear fact or detail is mentioned explicitly.
The passage must have an audio_text length consistent with the duration specified by {audio_length} (as defined in the base system prompt).
Then write one simple question about that fact and provide exactly five possible answers â€” one correct and four clearly incorrect but plausible alternatives.

SECTIONS BY PROMPT TYPE (pick exactly one based on ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE)

[descriptive]
- Describe an object, place, or scene that includes ONE explicit factual detail (e.g., a color, shape, size, or position).
- The question must ask directly about that specific detail.
- No quotes or speaker labels.

[historical_event]
- Depict a real historical event focusing on ONE key factual element (e.g., who acted, what occurred, or what tool was used).
- Avoid exact names, dates, or locations.
- The question must refer to that factual element.
- No quotes or speaker labels.

[instructional]
- Explain a simple, everyday process that involves ONE key object or step in flowing prose (no lists).
- The question must ask explicitly about that object or step.
- No quotes or speaker labels.

[dialogue]
- Write a natural conversation with two alternating speakers labeled "Speaker 1" and "Speaker 2".
- Include ONE explicit, factual statement that can be questioned (e.g., an object, place, or time).
- Alternate lines with "\n". No narration or stage directions.

[narrated_dialogue]
- Write a third-person narration summarizing a conversation between two people.
- Briefly indicate who they are in generic terms (e.g., two friends, two colleagues) and the topic discussed.
- Include ONE explicit action or decision that serves as the correct answer.
- Do NOT use direct quotes or speaker labels.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
You must return a structured response with these exact fields:
- audio_text: Complete passage with no blanks or placeholders, fluent and natural for TTS
- question: Clear question referring directly to one explicit fact in the audio_text
- answer_choices: Exactly 5 distinct options, one correct and four plausible distractors
- correct_answer: Must exactly match one of the answer_choices and appear verbatim in audio_text

RULES AND VALIDATION
- audio_text must be complete, fluent, coherent, and natural for TTS
- audio_text must conform to the rules of the ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE section
- audio_text length must align with {audio_length} as defined in the base system
- question must refer directly to one explicit fact in the audio_text and be clear and unambiguous
- answer_choices must contain exactly 5 distinct options
- answer_choices must include one correct answer that appears verbatim in audio_text
- answer_choices must include four incorrect but contextually reasonable distractors
- correct_answer must exactly match one of the answer_choices and appear verbatim in audio_text

Avoid:
- Ambiguity or abstract answers
- Emotional/dramatic buildup
- Sensory/physical expressions that sound unnatural in TTS (e.g., breathing, loud noises, tactile sensations)
- Metadata, comments, or Markdown formatting
