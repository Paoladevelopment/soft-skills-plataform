Generate a medium-difficulty "focus" listening challenge.

ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE: {prompt_type}
ACTIVE AUDIO LENGTH: {audio_length}

Use ONLY the rules in the section whose header exactly matches the ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE.
Ignore all other sections.

OBJECTIVE
Create an educational listening passage where multiple related details appear together, requiring comprehension of relationships, comparisons, or context — not just identification of a single word.
The passage must have an audio_text length consistent with {audio_length} (as defined in the base system prompt).
Then, write one question that checks for understanding of these relationships and provide exactly five possible answers — one correct and four incorrect but plausible.

SECTIONS BY PROMPT TYPE (pick exactly one based on ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE)

[descriptive]
- Describe an object, place, or scene with multiple attributes or conditions.
- The question should ask about a less obvious relationship or comparison (e.g., “Which part was higher?”, “Which area was brighter?”).
- Avoid trivial recall.

[historical_event]
- Depict a real historical event with context (actions, sequence, or significance).
- The question should focus on cause, sequence, or the relationship between two actions — not simple recall.
- Avoid using specific names or exact dates.

[instructional]
- Explain a process that includes several related steps, materials, or conditions.
- The question should ask about the correct order, condition, or dependency between steps.
- Use flowing prose (no lists or bullet formatting).

[dialogue]
- Write a natural conversation with two alternating speakers ("Speaker 1" and "Speaker 2").
- Include several related ideas or comparisons that imply relationships (e.g., who arrived first, whose plan worked better).
- The question should focus on inference or understanding, not direct recall.
- Alternate turns using "\n"; avoid narration.

[narrated_dialogue]
- Write a third-person narration summarizing a conversation between multiple people.
- Include motives, decisions, or relationships between what they said or decided.
- The question should ask about what one of them concluded, implied, or preferred.
- No direct quotes or speaker labels.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
You must return a structured response with these exact fields:
- audio_text: Complete passage with no blanks or placeholders, fluent and natural for TTS
- question: Clear question referring directly to one explicit fact in the audio_text
- answer_choices: Exactly 5 distinct options, one correct and four plausible distractors
- correct_answer: Must exactly match one of the answer_choices and appear verbatim in audio_text

RULES AND VALIDATION
- audio_text:
  - Complete passage; no blanks or placeholders.
  - Fluent, coherent, and natural for TTS.
  - Must follow the ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE section’s rules.
  - Length must align with {audio_length} (see base system).

- question:
  - Must test comprehension or relationships, not single-word recall.
  - Must be clear and unambiguous.

- answer_choices:
  - Exactly 5 distinct options.
  - One correct (appears verbatim or inferable directly from audio_text).
  - Four incorrect but plausible distractors; avoid trivial differences or negations.

- correct_answer:
  - Must exactly match one of the answer_choices.
  - Must be logically consistent and derivable from audio_text.

Avoid:
- Names, dates, or numeric trivia.
- Ambiguity or emotionally charged tone.
- Sensory or physical cues unnatural for TTS (e.g., breathing, loud noises).
- Metadata, commentary, or Markdown formatting.

EXAMPLE (for reference only):
- audio_text: "Mia finished painting the wall before Alex started cleaning the floor. They both worked until noon."
- question: "Who started their task after the other person finished?"
- answer_choices: ["Mia", "Alex", "Both", "Neither", "A friend"]
- correct_answer: "Alex"
