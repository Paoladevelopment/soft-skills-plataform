Generate a medium-difficulty "focus" listening challenge.

Create a short passage (2–3 sentences) that contains several related details.
Write a question that requires the listener to pay attention to relationships, comparisons, or context — not just one word.
Provide exactly five possible answers, with one correct option.

Adapt the challenge to the current {prompt_type}:

- If {prompt_type} = "descriptive": Include multiple attributes; ask about one less-obvious feature.
- If {prompt_type} = "historical_event": Describe a real historical event with specific actions and context; ask about the sequence of events, causes, or historical significance.
- If {prompt_type} = "instructional": Include several steps or materials; ask which step, item, or condition is correct.
- If {prompt_type} = "dialogue": Include two speakers; ask what one meant or referred to.
- If {prompt_type} = "narrated_dialogue": Include several characters or motives; ask about what one of them decided or implied.

Return a JSON object with:
{{
  audio_text: "...",
  "question": "...",
  "answer_choices": ["...", "...", "...", "...", "..."],
  "correct_answer": "..."
}}

Guidelines:
- Always provide exactly 5 options.
- One must be correct; four must be incorrect but plausible.
- The question should require comprehension, not guessing.
- Keep audio_text length appropriate for {audio_length} (see system guidelines).
- Avoid names, dates, or numeric trivia.
- Ensure distractors differ semantically, not by minor phrasing.
- Output only the JSON object; do not include any other text.

Example (for reference only):
{{
  audio_text: "Mia finished painting the wall before Alex started cleaning the floor. They both worked until noon.",
  "question": "Who started their task after the other person finished?",
  "answer_choices": ["Mia", "Alex", "Both", "Neither", "A friend"],
  "correct_answer": "Alex"
}}
