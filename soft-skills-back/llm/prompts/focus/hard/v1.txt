Generate a hard "focus" listening challenge.

ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE: {prompt_type}
ACTIVE AUDIO LENGTH: {audio_length}

Use ONLY the rules in the section whose header exactly matches the ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE.
Ignore all other sections.

OBJECTIVE
Create an educational listening passage with multiple ideas, contrasts, or subtle relationships that require reasoning or inference.
The passage must have an audio_text length consistent with the duration specified by {audio_length} (as defined in the base system prompt).
Then write one question that requires the listener to combine multiple clues or ideas to choose the correct answer.
Provide exactly five possible answers — one correct and four incorrect but plausible.

SECTIONS BY PROMPT TYPE (pick exactly one based on ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE)

[descriptive]
- Create a scene or object description with overlapping, conflicting, or contrasting details.
- The question should ask which interpretation or description fits best based on all the information.
- Avoid single-word recall; the answer should require reasoning from multiple clues.

[historical_event]
- Describe a real historical event with multiple causes, effects, or interpretations.
- Include context that allows for subtle inference about motive, cause, or consequence.
- The question should ask which explanation or interpretation best fits the passage.
- Avoid explicit names, dates, or numeric trivia.

[instructional]
- Explain a process that includes conditional or exceptional cases (e.g., “If X happens, then Y must be done.”).
- The question should require reasoning about which step or condition applies in a specific situation.
- Avoid simple recall of steps; require logical selection.

[dialogue]
- Write a realistic conversation between two alternating speakers ("Speaker 1" and "Speaker 2").
- Include differing perspectives, subtle implications, or misunderstandings.
- The question should ask about what one person implied, misunderstood, or decided.
- Alternate lines with "\n". Avoid narration or commentary.

[narrated_dialogue]
- Write a third-person narration summarizing a conversation or interaction involving motives, contrasting opinions, or consequences.
- Include multiple layers of reasoning (e.g., why someone changed their mind, what conclusion they reached, or what outcome occurred).
- The question should ask which interpretation or decision best fits the information.
- Do NOT use direct quotes or speaker labels.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
You must return a structured response with these exact fields:
- audio_text: Complete passage with no blanks or placeholders, fluent and natural for TTS
- question: Clear question referring directly to one explicit fact in the audio_text
- answer_choices: Exactly 5 distinct options, one correct and four plausible distractors
- correct_answer: Must exactly match one of the answer_choices and appear verbatim in audio_text

RULES AND VALIDATION
- audio_text:
  - Must be complete, coherent, and natural for TTS.
  - Must integrate multiple related ideas requiring reasoning or inference.
  - Must follow the rules of the ACTIVE PROMPT TYPE section.
  - Must align with {audio_length} as defined in the base system.

- question:
  - Must require reasoning or combining multiple pieces of information.
  - Must be unambiguous and tied to the logic of the passage.

- answer_choices:
  - Exactly 5 distinct options.
  - One correct (derivable from reasoning based on audio_text).
  - Four incorrect but contextually plausible distractors.
  - Avoid trivial opposites or superficial word swaps.

- correct_answer:
  - Must exactly match one of the answer_choices.
  - Must be logically deducible from the passage.

Avoid:
- Ambiguity or emotional dramatization.
- Names, specific dates, or numerical trivia.
- Sensory cues unnatural for TTS (e.g., breathing, sounds).
- Metadata, comments, or Markdown formatting.

EXAMPLE (for reference only):
- audio_text: "When the inventor presented her idea, most investors stayed silent. Later, two approached her privately, offering help only if she agreed to delay the launch."
- question: "Why did the investors approach her privately?"
- answer_choices: ["They disagreed about the idea", "They wanted to delay the project", "They needed more money", "They planned to reject her proposal", "They misunderstood the presentation"]
- correct_answer: "They wanted to delay the project"
